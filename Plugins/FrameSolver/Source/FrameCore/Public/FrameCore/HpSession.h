// Stateful seeded HP-FEM solve session. Models ReSolveSession: PIMPL, all Eigen confined to the
// .cpp Impl, Eigen-free public header, move-only, POD options/stats. It holds a NON-owning pointer
// into the PreparedSystem's Impl plus its own A-orthonormal seeded load-response basis and a
// matrix-free apply / preconditioner.
//
//   - setLoadBasis(loads): one-time seeding. Each 6N global load vector is reduced and solved via
//     the (already-factored) LDLT, then A-orthonormalized into the basis. The seeds span the load
//     family the structure will see each frame (gravity + candidate contacts).
//   - prepareCoarse(model): optional floor-aggregated coarse-grid correction for out-of-subspace
//     frames on tower-like structures (no effect on the in-subspace 0-iter path).
//   - solveFrame(model): the per-frame solve. Reuses the SAME RHS assembly / reactions / element
//     recovery as solveLoad, replacing only the linear solve: a Galerkin projection onto the seeded
//     basis gives a near-exact initial guess (in-subspace => ~0 PCG iters); a load that leaves the
//     subspace runs a full PCG; either way the LDLT factor is the always-correct fallback.
//
// Frame-only: a shell element routes every frame to LDLT. The apply + preconditioner are serial by
// default; opts.threads > 1 spawns a persistent pool that parallelizes the element apply (the per-
// frame bottleneck) and the block6 map, while the seeded basis and the LDLT stay single-threaded
// (Eigen is not thread-safe). Performance niche (honest): this wins ONLY when a fixed structure is
// re-solved many times under a low-dimensional seeded load family — there the in-subspace projection
// is ~0 PCG iters and the parallel apply is markedly faster than a reused LDLT back-substitution. It
// is NOT a general replacement for the direct solve: a single solve, or an arbitrary load that leaves
// the seeded subspace, is at best on par with (often slower than) a reused LDLT — so solve/solveLoad
// remain the default and the oracle.
//
// LIFETIME CONTRACT: the PreparedSystem MUST outlive the session (the session stores a non-owning
// pointer into it, like std::span). Moving or destroying it while the session is alive is undefined
// behaviour. solveFrame re-checks the model fingerprint each call: a structural change since
// assembleAndFactor yields a singular SolveResult (re-run assembleAndFactor).
