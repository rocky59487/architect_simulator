// UNIT BRIDGE (critical): the engine is a consistent N-mm-tonne-s system, but rho is given
// in kg/m^3. mass[tonne] = mass[kg]/1000 and 1 m^3 = 1e9 mm^3, so
//     rho[tonne/mm^3] = rho[kg/m^3] * 1e-12.
// A beam's weight per length  w = rho*A*g*1e-12  [N/mm];
// a shell's weight per area    p = rho*t*g*1e-12  [MPa]  (verified: tonne*mm/s^2 = N).
//
// Beams receive a MemberUDL with the global gravity rotated into the member's local axes
// (so a sloped/vertical member is handled correctly — the rotation is checked by the
// linear_deep_audit "sloped member gravity rotation" + "inclined cantilever equilibrium
// (sum Rz = rho*A*g*L)" oracles; the F18 main-gate fixtures themselves only exercise
// horizontal members). Shells receive the body load lumped to their four corner nodes as
// global -Z NodalLoads. Call this BEFORE solve(); it only appends.
