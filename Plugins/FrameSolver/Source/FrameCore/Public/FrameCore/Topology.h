// Topology.h — S7 evolutionary hard-kill topology optimization (BESO) + N2 collapse-robustness.
//
// runBESO iteratively DEACTIVATES the lowest-sensitivity members (Member::active, the S1 removal
// hook — zero-intrusion) until a target volume fraction is reached, ranking members by their elastic
// STRAIN ENERGY (the standard BESO sensitivity alpha_e = 1/2 u_e^T K_e u_e, reconstructed from the
// recovered local end forces * end displacements; bit-exact strain energy for UDL-free members, so
// sum(alpha_e) == 1/2 * F.u to round-off — the energy-balance oracle).
//
// Three must-haves the WS-I prototype exposed, plus the literature's standard fix:
//   (1) two-step sensitivity history averaging (Huang & Xie)        -> damps 0/1 oscillation
//   (2) compliance-jump stop  (C_k > tol * C_{k-1})                  -> the prototype's tail blew up 52x
//   (3) mechanism guard via the N1 ReSolveSession capacitance test  -> removal that makes a mechanism
//                                                                       is rolled back (no fresh factor)
//   (4) compliance-BEST rollback -> output the pre-blow-up topology, not the final one (WS-I remedy A)
//
// N2 (opt-in collapse robustness): every k steps, probe single-member-removal scenarios with the
// progressive-collapse driver; if any scenario Collapses, roll back this step's removal and LOCK
// those members (protected, never removable). Honest novelty positioning (WS_N section N2): the
// CLOSEST prior art is fail-safe TRUSS TO -- Stolpe 2019 and Zhu 2023 already optimize discrete
// members against single-member-removal damage cases (Jansen 2014 is the continuum SIMP original).
// What differs here is only the EVALUATOR: an LSP sequential-linear progressive-collapse driver
// (Stable/Collapsed endpoint + dlf + fragment connectivity) in place of plastic/conic LP. So this is
// NOT a new method and NOT a global-optimum guarantee, and must NOT be called "fail-safe".
//
// Honest scope: a heuristic (no global optimum; trusses' global optimum is LP/SDP ground structure);
// linear-elastic sensitivity; FIRST RELEASE IS ONE-WAY hard-kill (no bi-directional re-admission --
// a removed member has no internal forces to score); shell BESO not yet (ShellQuad::active is wired,
// but the Michell oracle is a truss). NOTE: TargetReached/converged means the VOLUME target was hit,
// NOT the Huang & Xie 2N-window compliance-stability criterion (not implemented -- inspect
// complianceHistory to judge stability). Pure POD/std public API (no Eigen, no UE).
